  # Instruction of user
  When you start the application, you will be taken to the registration page.
  You need to sign in or sign in to start using the store if you already have an account.
  By registering, you receive the default USER role and are available to you:
  * view items in the shop
  * add items to your bucket
  * complete order
  * view your orders
  
  If you want to try yourself as an ADMIN, you should change the role of a registered user in DB manually.
  * Example UPDATE `internet_shop`.`user_roles` SET` role_id` = '2' WHERE `user_roles_id` = '1';
  * Remark - USERS have role_id = 1 and ADMINS have role_id = 2;
  By logging into ADMIN, you can access:
  * view all users
  * add items to the store
